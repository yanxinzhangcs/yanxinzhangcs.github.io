**Abstract.**  
We study influential community search on bipartite graphs and propose the \((k,l)\)-influential community\) model based on **average** vertex weight across layers. We present a recursive search with a slim-tree structure and effective upper bounds. The problem is NP-hard; we further propose an \(O(n\log n)\) greedy approximation and a pruning algorithm. Experiments on 10 real graphs show effectiveness and efficiency.
