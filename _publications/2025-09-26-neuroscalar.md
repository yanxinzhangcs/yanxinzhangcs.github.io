**Abstract.**  
Cycle-accurate simulation is slow and often uses unrepresentative traces. We introduce a DL framework that predicts cycle-level performance for hypothetical designs from microarchitecture-independent features, enabling *in-the-wild* evaluation on existing silicon. With a lightweight trace collector and principled sampling, the system runs at 5 MIPS on a GPU with ~0.1% overhead; a co-designed on-chip accelerator achieves **85Ã—** over the GPU.
