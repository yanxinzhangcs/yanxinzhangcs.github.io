Welcome! I’m **Yanxin Zhang**, an undergraduate in Computer Science at UW–Madison (GPA 3.9/4.0).  
During my undergraduate studies, I have been fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Vikas Singh](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~vsingh/) and [Prof. Karu Sankaralingam](https://karu.sites.cs.wisc.edu/wiki/) on research in **Machine Learning for Systems (ML for Sys)**.  
Before that, I worked under Prof. Singh’s guidance on **Machine Learning** and **LLM inference** projects.  
In Summer 2025, I interned at **Amazon Web Services (AWS), Seattle** as a Software Engineer Intern, where I focused on **building an LLM-powered agent** for infrastructure workflows.
